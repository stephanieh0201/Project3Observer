##Problem Solved by Observer Pattern:
Observer pattern allows a subject to notify any subscribers (observers) when there is a state change.

For our project, we've created a Messenger. Users will join the messenger (similar to a group chat) to receive
notifications. The messenger will notify all users any time the state changes.

This allows the messenger to simultaneously notify all users anytime a new message is sent.

It allows consistent updates. The messenger only has to update, and the users will check the new state.
